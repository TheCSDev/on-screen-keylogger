## On-Screen Keylogger
(Please note that this isn't an actual keylogger, it's just the name). The On-Screen Keylogger is an application that displays on a virtual keyboard which keys you are pressing. Some of the uses for this application may include things such as wanting to see which keys you are pressing, or for example when you are recording and you want the viewer of the recording to be able to see which keys are being pressed.

## Custom layouts
This application also supports custom layouts. Custom layouts are basically like themes, except they allow you to completely define what the UI will look like. With custom layouts, you can customize and even completely change the entire UI of the application. Custom layouts are primarily written in HTML and CSS, but they also support JS, and with them, you can make anything a modern webpage supports. The layouts are stored in the `./layouts` folder, and in there, you can create your own custom layouts.
Below are a few example images of custom layouts:

Name: `cyber`. This is a cyber-city themed layout that is planned to be released in a future version right after v1.0.

## System requirements
This application runs on `Windows`, and it is best to use `Windows 10` or higher. This application also uses the Microsoft's `WebView2` component to display the UI, therefore you need to make sure your system meets the requirements for running `WebView2` on it. This application is also written using the `.NET Framework 4.8`, and the `WPF` UI framework. So you will need to make sure your operating system supports those as well.
